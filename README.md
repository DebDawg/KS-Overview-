Deliverable 3

##Overview: 
The purpose of this project was to familiarize and learn how to read visual data.  As a class, and individually we 
became aquainted with Excel.  We learned to use it's many facets to organize and convert data into visual and structural designs. 
This allowed us to attempt our first goal of reading and analyzing data for our virtual client Louise.

##Analysis and Challenges: 
Starting the first module was exciting and I anticipated the class being challenging.  After all I am instrinsically motivated, it felt exciting to learn new functions other than Sums and grouoing cells.  The challenges I faced were more about the pace of the first week, it was so fast. Overall the filtering and charting were the least stressful, escept my Outcomes based on Goals Line chart, I could not figure out the how to change the data in the x-axis, I ran out of time.  I had to start learning the next Module.  The other time consuming issue for me was the CountIF formulas.  Those are eye-crossing frustrating calculations.  I had to re-reaad the module, google search, rewatch the class, and watch multiple Excel for Dummies type YouTube vidoes.  I still am not sure I get it, but I'm not going to give up.  This simplist issues I was having is the name of my saved data, wasn't linking to my functions.  I was placing the cursor in the wrong cell to pull up data, I would highlight the whole date table and pull into a pivot chart and it didn't pull all the data.  simple little tricks and tips watiching the class and watchng videos on You Tube that tought me where I need a colon or space or $... I will keep watching videos and rewatching classed to make sure I can keep up. 

##Theater Outcomes and Launch Date:  
By looking at the data it feels like the outcomes by lauch date were more successful in the warmer months, however I see that as the US Summer times.  Most of the countries are warmer climate areas, so more people are out and about.  Plays can also be huge in the winter months when it's nice to be inside.  So with both of those thoughts it hard to say except June and July are the most successful months on the chart.

##Outcomes Based on Goals: 
According to the data, it seems the smaller the goal to more successful.  Not many goals were set above 15,000, and the percentage failed increased as the goal amount increased.  Finding and setting a reasonable goal based on time of year and goal amount could be acheived by filtering and gathering that data. Also by launching in June and setting a launch date of a few month, rather than a full year, could be analyzed to see if this would be successful data.

##The limitiations
One limitation I can think of is not knowing a more generalized demographic location.  If we knew which cities the theater was opening as well as the dote of the ooening night vs. other nights, all that might allow Louise to make a demographic move based on the "backers" and the "blurb".  At least with this information she could find out if population size makes a difference per capita?

##Alternate options:
Other possile Tables/Graphs cold be which "Blurbs" (content) were most popular based on genre?
